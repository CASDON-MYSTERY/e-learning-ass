            <h1>TREE</h1>
            <section>
                <p> Tree is a discrete structure that represents hierarchical relationships between individual elements or nodes or vertices, with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root or having any closed loops (cycles).
                    It is a connected acyclic undirected graph. There is one and only one path between every pair of vertices in a tree.</p>

                    <li>
                        The first node from where the tree originates is called as a <strong> root node</strong>. In any tree, there must be only one root node. We can never have multiple root nodes in a tree data structure. Node <strong>F</strong> is
                        the root node in the diagram above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The connecting link between any two nodes is called as an <strong> edge </strong> . In a tree with n number of nodes, there are exactly (n-1) number of edges.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The node which has a branch from it to any other node is called as a <strong>parent node </strong> . In other words, the node which has one or more children is called as a parent node. In a tree, a parent node can have any number
                        of child nodes. <strong>F,B,G,D,I</strong> are parents nodes in the diagram above.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The node which does not have any child is called as a <strong>leaf node </strong> . Leaf nodes are also called as <strong>external nodes </strong> or <strong> terminal nodes </strong> . Leaf nodes in the diagram above are <strong>A,C,E,H</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The node which has at least one child is called as an <strong> internal node </strong>. Internal nodes are also called as <strong> non-terminal nodes </strong> . Every non-leaf node is an internal node. <strong>F,B,G,D,I</strong>                        are internal nodes in the diagram above.
                    </li>
                    <li> The node which is a descendant of some node is called as a <strong>child node</strong> . All the nodes except root node are child nodes. <strong>B,G,A,D,I,C,E,H</strong> are child nodes in the diagram above. </li>
                    <li> Nodes which belong to the same parent are called as <strong>siblings</strong> . In other words, nodes with the same parent are sibling nodes. <strong>B</strong> and <strong>G</strong>, <strong>A</strong> and <strong>D</strong>, <strong>C</strong>                        and <strong>E</strong> are siblings in the above diagram.</li>

                    <li> In a tree, each child from a node forms a <strong>subtree </strong> recursively. Every child node forms a subtree on its parent node.</li>
